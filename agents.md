# Development Notes

## Repository overview
- The project now consists of three primary modules: `wb_client.py` providing HTTP helpers for Wildberries endpoints, `wb_parser.py` offering higher-level normalization utilities, and `wb_discovery.py` exposing a CLI for collecting Wildberries `nm_id` values from catalog pages.
- `__init__.py` currently exports nothing and simply marks the repository as a Python package root.

## Environment
- Requires Python 3.10 or newer.
- Third-party dependency: `requests` (install with `python -m pip install requests`). No additional requirements file is tracked yet.
- Tests rely on `pytest`. Install with `python -m pip install pytest` when running the suite locally.

## Quick checks
- Run `python -m compileall etl/parser/wb_client.py etl/parser/wb_parser.py etl/parser/wb_discovery.py` to ensure the parser modules pass a basic syntax check.
- Execute the automated tests with `PYTHONPATH=etl/parser pytest` to validate the HTTP helpers, parser, and discovery CLI without hitting the network (tests patch out HTTP calls).
- Optional: lint manually with your preferred tool (e.g., `ruff`, `flake8`)â€”no automated linters are configured in the repo.

## Manual verification
- When network access is available you can sanity-check the HTTP client by calling:
  ```bash
  python - <<'PY'
  from wb_client import get_card_api, get_info_card_json, get_content_v2
  print(get_card_api(258368289).keys())
  print(bool(get_info_card_json(258368289)))
  print(bool(get_content_v2(258368289)))
  PY
  ```
- To validate the full normalization flow use the parser helper:
  ```bash
  python - <<'PY'
  from wb_parser import fetch_product_raw
  product = fetch_product_raw(258368289)
  print(product.to_dict())
  PY
  ```
  Inspect that the returned structure contains the expected Wildberries product data.
- To perform a real end-to-end discovery run (requires network access) you can execute:
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=etl/parser python -m wb_discovery --input etl/parser/categories.json --cat-id 120602 --pages 1 --output /tmp/nm_ids.json
  ```
  Inspect `/tmp/nm_ids.json` (or the specified output path) for a list of collected `nm_id` values.

## Formatting & style
- Stick to PEP 8 conventions and prefer explicit type hints using Python 3.10+ union syntax (`int | None`).

## Change Log
- Added `wb_batch.py` providing a CLI for batch fetching Wildberries cards and exporting JSONL output.
- Utility supports nm_id lists from files or CLI tokens and reports success/error counts.
- Introduced a comprehensive pytest suite for `wb_discovery.py` covering category loading, catalog pagination, and output writers.
